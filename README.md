[HERE is the link to the dashboard](https://rubbishlove.shinyapps.io/dashboard/)

This repository will hold the code and structure layout for the dashboard. 

# What is the dashboard?

The dashboard is an interactive data analysis board for a Community Cleanup held by Rubbish of SoMa West, San Fancisco, CA.

# How does the dashboard work?

It utilizes a Leaflet map for the base of the board, showing all the litter, and other items tracked, on the map itself. It has several graphs that relay from what is currently showing on the users map; a bar-graph, a proportion bar, and a binned heat map. These 3 graphs will change based on what the user is looking at, and can be disables.
